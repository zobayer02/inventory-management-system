# Inventory Management System for Warehouse

A comprehensive **Inventory Management System** built to streamline and automate product management for warehouses. This system is especially useful for businesses that **import products from abroad and sell them locally**, offering complete control over stock, sales and reporting.

This project was developed for **Md. Nazmul Sarkar** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-nazmul-sarkar/)) to support his business operations with a robust digital solution.
